# hello-world
first repository!


All these buckets of rain, you can't forget about it, you say I never tried.
I am a gentleman, didn't I answer every time that you call, pick you up when you fall
But you never listen at all
You were just always talking about changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man.
